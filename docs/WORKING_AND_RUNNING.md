# Working And Running Guide

# 1) What this app does

This app is a role-based campus portal:

- `faculty` and `student` users can register/login
- Faculty can create posts (with optional image)
- Faculty can delete their own post image
- Faculty can delete their own post
- Any logged-in user can comment on posts

# 2) Tech stack

- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB Atlas + Mongoose
- Auth: JWT (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
- Uploads: `multer` (stored in backend `uploads/` folder)

```

# 4) Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (Node 20+ recommended)
- npm
- MongoDB Atlas cluster + DB user
- Atlas Network Access configured to allow your current public IP

# 5) Environment setup

## Backend

```bash
cd /Users/fci/Documents/faculty-student-portal/backend
cp .env.example .env
```

Set values in `.env`:

```env
PORT=5001
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<url-encoded-password>@<cluster-host>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=<long-random-secret>
```

## Frontend

```bash
cd /Users/fci/Documents/faculty-student-portal/frontend
cp .env.example .env
```

Set:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

# 6) How to run

Open two terminals.

## Terminal 1: backend

```bash
cd /Users/fci/Documents/faculty-student-portal/backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Expected logs:

- `Server running on port 5001`
- `MongoDB connected`

## Terminal 2: frontend

```bash
cd /Users/fci/Documents/faculty-student-portal/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

- `http://localhost:5173`

# 7) How app flow works

## Auth flow

1. User registers or logs in from frontend.
2. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT + user data.
3. Frontend stores token in `localStorage` (`portal_token`).
4. Frontend sends token in `Authorization` header for protected routes.
5. Backend middleware verifies token and loads current user.

## Post flow

1. Faculty submits title/content (and optional image).
2. Frontend sends `multipart/form-data` for post creation.
3. Backend stores image file in `backend/uploads/`.
4. Backend stores post in MongoDB with `imagePath`.
5. Post list response includes `imageUrl` for UI display.

## Delete flow

Delete image:
1. Faculty calls `DELETE /api/posts/:postId/image`.
2. Backend clears `imagePath` from post and removes file from disk.

Delete post:
1. Faculty calls `DELETE /api/posts/:postId`.
2. Backend deletes post comments, image file (if any), and post document.

## Comment flow

1. User sends comment to `POST /api/posts/:postId/comments`.
2. Backend creates comment linked to post and author.
3. Frontend updates comment list.

# 8) API endpoints summary

Base URL: `http://localhost:5001/api`

## Auth

- `POST /auth/register`
- `POST /auth/login`
- `GET /auth/me` (protected)

## Posts

- `GET /posts` (protected)
- `POST /posts` (protected, faculty, multipart field name: `image`)
- `DELETE /posts/:postId` (protected, faculty, own posts only)
- `DELETE /posts/:postId/image` (protected, faculty, own posts only)

## Comments

- `POST /posts/:postId/comments` (protected)

# 9) Common issues and fixes

## `querySrv EBADNAME _mongodb._tcp.<cluster>`

Cause: placeholder URI still in `.env`.
Fix: replace `<cluster>` and other placeholders with real Atlas values.

## Atlas connection error / whitelist issue

Cause: your public IP is not allowed in Atlas Network Access.
Fix: add your IP in Atlas `Security -> Network Access`.

## 401 unauthorized

Cause: missing/expired token.
Fix: log out and log in again.

## 403 forbidden while deleting post/image

Cause: only faculty can delete, and only their own posts can be deleted.

## Upload rejected

Cause: non-image file or size > 5MB.
Fix: upload an image file under 5MB.

# 10) Security notes

- Never commit `.env` with real credentials
- Rotate exposed MongoDB passwords immediately
- Use a strong random `JWT_SECRET`
- Restrict Atlas IP allowlist in production
